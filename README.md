# Intern-Project
My code for design of an intze water tank.
The program's limitations are:
a. It calculates area of steel required but does not give area of steel provided. That is left to the designer.
b. Shear Calculations are done but the stirrup legs, reinforcement and spacing must be calculated by the designer.
c. The centre of mass needs to be calculated and input as the distance from the ground level.
d. Values from SP 16 is required while calculating necessary ratios for columns, beams and slabs.
Please email me @sddahal4@gmail.com if you find any errors in the program.
